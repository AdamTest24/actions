# setup-sandpaper

This action is modified from
[r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) to setup
sandpaper for use in Carpentries lessons. The vast majority of this workflow was
written by Jim Hester at RStudio. Zhian Kamvar mostly just added tweaks.

It uses the following process:

- Installing [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/)
- Setting up a dependency cache using [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache).
- Installing system dependencies if needed using [rstudio/r-system-requirements](https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements).
- Printing the installed session info using [sessioninfo](https://github.com/r-lib/sessioninfo).

# Usage

Inputs available

- `cache-version` - default `1`. If you need to invalidate the existing cache pass any other number and a new cache will be used. You can use a secret called `CACHE_VERSION` set to a date for to reset the cache without needing to commit it. 
- `sandpaper-version` the version of sandpaper to use (for testing) in the remotes syntax (e.g. `'carpentries/sandpaper@branch'` will use a branch from the carpentries repo). This can be used to try alternate versions of sandpaper.
Basic:
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@master
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1
- uses: carpentries/actions/setup-sandpaper@main
  with:
    cache-version: ${{ secrets.CACHE_VERSION }}
```
