# Carpentries GitHub Actions

This is a set of actions that will facilitate constructing GitHub workflows that
can validate, comment on, and create pull requests. For a rationale of how these
actions were created, see [the rationale document](rationale.md).

Several workflows created from these actions can be found in [The {sandpaper} 
package](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/tree/main/inst/workflows/).
